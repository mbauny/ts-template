# Motivation

This repository serves as a personal template for my TypeScript projects. I use it to centralize and share configurations for the tools I use the most, such as:

-   ESLint
-   Git
-   GitHub
-   Jest
-   NodeJS
-   Prettier
-   TypeScript
-   VSCode
-   Webpack

Still learning, please don't judge too harshly ðŸ˜…

Suggestions are very welcome!

# To-Do

-   [ ] Git hooks
