# Motivation
This repository serves as a personal template for my TypeScript projects. I use it to centralize and share configurations for the tools I use the most, such as:
* TypeScript
* NodeJS
* VSCode
* ESLint
* Git
* GitHub
* Webpack
* Jest

Still learning, please don't judge too harshly ðŸ˜…

Suggestions are very welcome!
