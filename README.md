# Motivation
This repository serves as a personal template for my TypeScript projects. I use it to centralize and share configurations for the tools I use the most, such as:
* TypeScript
* NodeJS
* Jest
* ESLint
* Webpack
* VSCode
* GitHub
* Git

Still learning, please don't judge too harshly ðŸ˜…

Suggestions and are very welcome!
